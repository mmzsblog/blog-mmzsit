Chapter 2 Examples
==================
This folder contains example code for chapter 2 of Spring in Action, 4th Edition.
The samples are split across multiple directories:

 * stereo-autoconfig  : Examples illustrating component-scanning and auto-wiring for section 2.2.
 * stereo-javaconfig  : Examples illustrating Java configuration for section 2.3.
 * stereo-xmlconfig   : Examples illustrating XML configuration for section 2.4.
 * stereo-mixedconfig : Examples illustrating mixed XML and Java configuration for section 2.5.

Note that because the examples evolve throughout the chapter and the book's text sometimes
shows multiple ways of accomplishing a goal, not all variations of the code in the book will
be represented in these samples. You are invited to use this source code as a starting point
and experiment using the variations presented in the text.
