This example demonstrates how to send messages to specific users.

After starting the application, point your browser at localhost:8080/stomp and signin as either chuck/password or fred/password.
Type messages into the form and submit.

To really demonstrate user-targeted messages, open the app in two separate browsers, one signed in as fred and one signed in as chuck.
Then send messages that mention the other user (e.g., "Hello @chuck" or "Hiya @fred").
