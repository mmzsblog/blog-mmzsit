low-level-websocket
===================
This is a simple example of using Spring's low-level support for websocket.
This is not necessarily the right thing to do in most cases, as Spring's
higher-level, Spring MVC-based approach is much cleaner and easier.
Moreover, the messages sent with this example are raw text, whereas STOMP
would give them a defined structure.

Nevertheless, this was a worthwhile project to create to understand how
Spring's low-level websocket support works.
