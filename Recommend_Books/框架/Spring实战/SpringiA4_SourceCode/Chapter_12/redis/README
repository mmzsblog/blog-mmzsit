This project contains examples from section 12.3 of Spring in Action 4. The main class
to pay attention to is src/test/java/cart/CartTest.java. This class contains several
test cases that exercise RedisTemplate as discussed in section 12.3. The test method
names correspond to the subsections of section 12.3.

As these tests perform operations against a Redis server, you must have a Redis server
running and listening for requests on localhost port 6379 (Redis' default port).
